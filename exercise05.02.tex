\paragraph{Exercise 5.2} Let us start by calculating how many people we would
need to have in a room before it was more likely than not that two had the
same last four digits. It is easier to think about the configuration where
people do not share a password than about configurations where some two people
do. The first person in the room has a password. The probability that the second
person has a different password is $\left(1- \frac{1}{4^{10}}\right)$. The
probability that the third person in the room then has a password dofferent from
the first two, given that the first two people have different passwords, is
$\left(1- \frac{2}{4^{10}}\right)$. Continuing on, the probability that the
$kth$ person in the room has a different password than the first $k-1$,
assuming that the first $k-1$ have different passwords, is
$\left(1- \frac{k-1}{4^{10}}\right)$. So the probability that $n$ people all
have different passwords is
\[
  \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} \left( 1 - \frac{j}{4^{10}}\right).
\]
Using that $1 - \frac{k}{n} \approx e^{-\frac{k}{n}}$ when $k \ll n$, we see that
if $n$ is small compared to $4^{10}$ then
\[
  \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} \left( 1 - \frac{j}{4^{10}}\right)
  /approx \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} e^{-\frac{j}{4^{10}}}
  = \exp \left\{ - \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{j}{4^{10}} \right\}
  = e^{-\frac{(n-1)n}{2 \cdot 4^{10}}}
  \approx e^{-\frac{n^2}{2 \cdot 4^{10}}}.
\]
Hence the value for $n$ at which the probability that $n$ people all have
different passwords is smaller than $1/2$ is approxuimately given by the
unequality
\[
  e^{-\frac{n^2}{2 \cdot 4^{10}}} < \frac{1}{2}
  \Leftrightarrow e^{\frac{n^2}{2 \cdot 4^{10}}} > 2
  \Leftrightarrow \frac{n^2}{2 \cdot 4^{10}} > \ln(2)
  \Leftrightarrow n > \sqrt{2 \cdot 4^{10} \cdot \ln(2)}.
\]
Therefore, with 1206 people in a room the probability that two of them have
the same password is greater than $1/2$. \\
Similarly one can argue that $\sqrt{2 \cdot 9^{10} \cdot \ln(2)} \approx 69,524$
numbers can be issued before it will be more likely than not that there is a
duplicate number. \\
If Social Security numbers had 13 digits we would still nee 1206 people in a room
before it is more likely than not that two have the same password. However, we
could issue $\sqrt{2 \cdot 13^{10} \cdot \ln(2)} \approx 437,164$ numbers before
it is more likely than not that there is a duplicate number.
