\paragraph{Exercise 2.2} Let $X$ be the number of times the sequence "proof"
appears. $X$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $n = 999,995$ and
$p = 26^{-5}$. Consequently
\[
  \E\left[ X \right] = 999,995 \cdot 26^{-5} \approx 0.084.
\]
That is, the expected number of times the sequence "proof" appears is
approximately 0.
