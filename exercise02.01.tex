\paragraph{Exercise 2.1} Suppose we roll a fair $k$-sided die with the numbers 1
through $k$ on the dieâ€™s faces. Let $X$ be the number that appears. Then,
\[
  \E\left[X\right]
  = \sum_{x=1}^k x \cdot \pr\left(X = x\right)
  = \sum_{x=1}^k x \cdot \frac{1}{k}
  = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{x=1}^k x
  = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
  = \frac{k+1}{2}.
\]
