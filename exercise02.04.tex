\paragraph{Exercise 2.4} $~$ \\[0.2cm]
\textbf{Theorem 2.13}: $\E\left[X^k \right] \geq \E[X]^k$ for any even integer
$k \geq 1$. \\[0.2cm]
\textit{Proof}. By Jensen's inequality, $\E\left[f(X)\right] \geq f\left(\E[X]\right)$
for any convex function $f$. If $f$ is twice differentiable and its second
derivative is non-negative, then $f$ is convex. Let $k \in \mathbb{N}^+$ be an
even integer and $f(x) = x^k$. Then $f$ is twice differentiable. The second
derivative of $f$ is $f''(x) = k(k - 1)x^{k-2}$ which is non-negative for all
$x \in \mathbb{R}$.
